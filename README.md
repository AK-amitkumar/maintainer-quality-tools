QA Tools for Odoo maintainers
=============================

The goal is to provide helpers to ensure the quality of Odoo addons. 

Sample travis configuration file (for version 7.0)
--------------------------------------------------

To setup the TravisCI continuous integration for your project, just copy the
content of the [`/sample_files`](https://github.com/OCA/maintainer-quality-tools/tree/master/sample_files)
to your projectâ€™s root directory.

If your project depends on other OCA/Github repositories simply add the following under `before_install` section:

    install:
      - git clone https://github.com/OCA/a_project_x ${HOME}/a_project_x -b ${VERSION}
      - git clone https://github.com/OCA/a_project_y ${HOME}/a_project_y -b ${VERSION}

The addons path used will automatically consider these repositories.


Sample coveralls configuration file
------------------------------------

You can use the following sample (also available in the `sample_files` directory) to
configure the reporting by coveralls.io. Copy it to `.coveragerc` in the root
of your project, and change the include value to match the name of your
project:

    [report]
    include =
        */<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME_HERE>/*

    omit =
        */tests/*
        *__init__.py

    # Regexes for lines to exclude from consideration
    exclude_lines =
        # Have to re-enable the standard pragma
        pragma: no cover

        # Don't complain about null context checking
        if context is None:
